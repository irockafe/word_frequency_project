    <h1>About the Project</h1>    
    <p>Currently, only plain-text (.txt) files are supported.</p>
      <p>
      While the program should be able to create frequency lists for any language where words are separated by spaces (sorry, Chinese!), it can only lemmatize words in Russian thanks to <a href="https://pymorphy2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">pymorphy2</a>.  </p>
      <p>In non-linguist terms, that means that walk, walks, and walked will be counted as separate words. But хожу, ходит, и ходили will all be counted as ходить.</p> 
      100 pages of text can be processed in roughly 90 seconds.
    <br>
    Hopefully more languages, file formats, and features will come in the future.
    </p>
      Best,<br>
      Isaac
